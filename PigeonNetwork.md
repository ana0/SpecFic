**Jane:** Sandy!

**Sandy:** What's up?

**Jane:** The weirdest thing just happened!

**Sandy:** Uh, what?

**Jane:** A  bird just flew through the window

**Sandy:** Was it a pigeon?

**Jane:** Yeah! And you'll never believe what it had with it

**Sandy:** Was it an sd card?

**Jane:** What? How did you know

**Sandy:** It's from Rebecca

**Jane:** uhhhh...

**Sandy:** It's kind of a long story

**Jane:** .. and are you gonna tell it?

**Sandy:** uh yeah, one sec though, let's open it first. It might be important. Pass it over?

**Jane:** Are you sure it's ok to just put this sd card in your computer? Sounds sketchy

**Sandy:** I told you, it's from Rebecca

**Jane:** How do you know it's from Rebecca?

**Sandy:** Smell that?

**Jane:** Smell what? I guess I smell lavendar .. and maybe .. thyme?

**Sandy:** Yeah I told Rebecca to put lavendar and thyme in the envelope with her next message - and I told her in the void room, so there's no way anyone could have heard me. 

**Jane:** Well that is the most wack authentication system I ever heard of

**Sandy:** That's the point. It's weird enough that *they* would never think of it. Come on, let's read the message

**Jane:** ok


> sandy opens and reads the message


**Sandy:** oh shit

**Jane:** What, what's it say?

**Sandy:** The aviary's been compromised

**Jane:** What's an aviary?

**Sandy:** It's where they keep the pigeons. Rebecca's town has been experimenting an interspecies DIWO network ... but it looks like they've been infiltrated by government pigeons

**Jane:** What are they gonna do?

**Sandy:** I don't know ... let me think for a minute ...

**Jane:** uh, Sandy?

**Sandy:** shh, I'm thinking

**Jane:** but .. can we talk about the pigeon?

**Sandy:** What? Why

**Jane:** It just pooped on the floor
